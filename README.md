# Boston Housing Linear Regression Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the **Boston Housing dataset** using **linear regression** to understand the relationship between housing features and prices. The analysis includes data preprocessing, model fitting, evaluation, and interpretation of influential points.

## Key Components
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and preparing features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding key trends and distributions.
- **Model Building**: Implementing multiple linear regression.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².
- **Influence Analysis**: Identifying high-leverage and influential points.

## Key Findings
- Certain features (e.g., crime rate, number of rooms) strongly impact housing prices.
- Some data points have high leverage, influencing model predictions significantly.
- Model performance can be improved by addressing influential outliers.
